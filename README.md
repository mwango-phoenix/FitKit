## Motivation and Process
I always have trouble knowing what to do in the gym, especially when it is busy and the options are limited. Fitness has become a pillar of my weekly routine and I have struggled for some time with consistency.  Despite the abundance of workout apps, I always found it to be lacking towards helping me reach my goals with plyometrics and cardio technique practices. As someone with a swimming background, looking to train to improve my power and endurance, current app set ups did not allow me to plan well towards my goals. 

The app is meant to help with planning, providing alternative options for when equipment is being taken up, and to help train athleticism, not just muscle building. 

The app began with user interviews from peers of mine with similar focuses: identifying pain points and key features. Using Figma, I developed low and high-fidelity wireframes focused on clear navigation and ease of access. 
The frontend uses React Native for cross-platform support with enhancements from libraries like Reanimated and Gesture Handler for responsive UI interactions. 
The backend leverages firebase for real-time data sync as well as user auth and cloud storage.
